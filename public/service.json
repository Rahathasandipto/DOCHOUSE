        "description": " Even though it sounds like a mouthful, otolaryngologists actually specialize in the ears, nose, and throat. And as of the 2022 Medscape study, these head and neck specialists are the most likely to report happy marriages. According to the CMA, otolaryngologists work relatively stable working hours (at around 60 hours per week) and earn around $318,950 a year after overhead. With 65% of them satisfied with their current professional life, and almost half of them satisfied with their work life balance, otolaryngologists have the potential to be one of the most satisfied physicians overall."
